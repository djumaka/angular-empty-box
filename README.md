# angular-empty-box - An empty working angular boilerplate
An empty basic Angular.js boilerplate project with require.js autoloading of modules and dependencies.
Used https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide as a guide to structure project code and folders.

## To do
* What's left is actually to enable autoloading of controller modules on-demand, rather then loading them on page load.
* Do some modules dependency management (angular, angular-strap, etc) to help kickstart more complex projects
* Fix the # SEO issue in .htaccess and in angular.config.js
* Start cursing the whole world if Angular 2 comes with something stable within the upcomming few months
