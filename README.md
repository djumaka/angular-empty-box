# An angular boilerplate with dynamic controllers
An empty basic Angular.js boilerplate project with require.js autoloading of modules and dependencies.
I used https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide as a guide to structure project code and folders.

## Currently has:
* Dynamic loading of controllers upon $routeResolver.when() call.

## To do
* Do some modules dependency management (angular, angular-strap, etc) to help kickstart more complex projects
* Fix the # SEO issue in .htaccess and in angular.config.js
* Start cursing the whole world if Angular 2 comes with something stable within the upcomming few months

I would very much appreciate comments or improvement suggestions. Pull requests are more than welcome.

This project is based on the work of Dan Wahling (http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/dynamically-loading-controllers-and-views-with-angularjs-and-requirejs).
